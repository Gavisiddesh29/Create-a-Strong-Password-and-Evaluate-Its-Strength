## **Steps to Create and Evaluate a Strong Password**

1. **Generate Passwords with Different Complexities**

   * Examples:

     * `hello123` (weak)
     * `Hello@123` (moderate)
     * `H3ll0_W@rld2025!` (strong)
     * `G8#xL!9&zWq@5Y!m` (very strong)

2. **Include Key Components**

   * Uppercase & lowercase letters
   * Numbers
   * Symbols (@, #, %, etc.)
   * Minimum 12â€“16 characters

3. **Test Password Strength Online**

   * Tools used: Kaspersky, NordPass

4. **Record Feedback & Scores**

   * Weak: Too short or common
   * Medium: Better, but can improve length
   * Strong: Good length and character variety
   * Very Strong: High randomness and complexity

5. **Follow Best Practices**

   * Avoid common words or reused passwords
   * Use unique, long, and mixed-character passwords
   * Store securely using a password manager

6. **Understand Common Attacks**

   * **Brute Force**: Cracked by short/simple passwords
   * **Dictionary Attack**: Defeated by randomness
   * **Credential Stuffing**: Prevented by unique passwords
   * **Phishing**: Avoid by cautious behavior

7. **Conclusion on Complexity & Security**

   * More complex = more secure
   * Random, long, and diverse passwords resist attacks effectively
